    title: 'How many channels can participate in the cross-promotion?',
    body: 'We do not endorse promoting a long list of channel links. It not only makes things look ugly but also reduces the effectiveness and doesn’t allow the admin to measure results. Therefore, the Erzy allows 1-on-1 cross-promotion where one channel link will be posted per channel.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Do I need to pay to do cross-promotion using Erzy?',
    body: 'No! Currently Erzy is totally free and comes without any hidden fees. In the future we will choose a way to monetize our service, but at the moment we still haven’t figured it out.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Will your bot post things on my channel by itself?',
    body: 'No! Erzy bot only posts cross-promotion posts that you have already approved. Nothing will be posted without your approval.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Can I schedule several cross-promotions?',
    body: 'Yes, you can schedule as many cross-promotions as you want. However, the bot can only perform 1 cross-promotion at a time. Whenever you schedule multiple cross-promotions at a time, make sure that their duration does not clash with that of each other.',
  },
  {
    title:
      'Can I conduct cross-promotion of Telegram group chats or private channels?',
    body: 'Erzy supports private channels, but  Telegram group chats are not included in cross-promotion as of now. Please stick to our updates to see if this feature is added in the future.',
  },
  {
    title:
      'What happens if I delete the bot from my channel during the cross-promotion?',
    body: 'Erzy bot hates it when you delete it during a cross-promotion. It gives you a warning and in case of repetition, your channel will be blocked permanently.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Can I edit the channel description after starting the cross-promo?',
    body: 'You can edit the channel description anytime. However, the updated description will not be effective for any running cross-promotion. The change will be applied to your channel in the next cross-promotion.',
  },
  {
    title:
      'I registered with bot but there are no channels in the "Suggested channels list", what can I do?',
    body: 'If you do not see any channels in the ‘suggested channels’ list, this means that there are no registered channels of the same rage of average post views in your category. You may check Invite list where you can choose to invite channel by generating invitation message(bot will send it to you in Telegram) which you can forward to channel admin to invite him/her to join you in for cross promotion. Once invited admin has joined you will get notified.',
